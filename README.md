# hello-world

Hi Brian, here!
I'm a novice in the coding community. I know at one point you all got butterflies when you started. It's scary and exciting at the same time because of all the possibilities. I previously worked in a front end tech support position. I wasn't the best when I started it took me over six months on the floor before I felt comfortable to begin implementing changes. Fast forward, I Fell in love with process implementation.  I'm going to learn as much as possible. I promise everyone I will be contributing to this community within two months.  

I look forward to collaborating with everyone in the future. So, who else likes to wear a black hoodie and feel like Mr. Robot?
